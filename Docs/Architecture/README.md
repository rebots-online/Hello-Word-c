# Architecture Diagrams

This folder contains UML and Mermaid diagrams summarizing the Divinum Officium web application as referenced from [the original perl implementation](https://github.com/rebots-online/divinum-officium/tree/master/web).

- `webapp_flowchart.*` shows the high level request flow.
- `liturgical_calendar.*` depicts the main calendar reckoning logic.
- `database_schema.*` outlines the translation from the original flat-file structure to SQLite tables.
- `optimal_sqlite_schema.*` highlights a proposed schema for future optimizations.

These diagrams serve as a snapshot reference for further planning and review.
